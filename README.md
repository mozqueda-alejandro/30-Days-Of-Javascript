# 30-Days-Of-JavaScript
This repository contains my personal implementation of the exercises for the "30-Days-Of-JavaScript" programming challenge. Each folder corresponds to a specific day of JavaScript topics and contains the exercises completed for that day.

## Project Description
The 30-Days-Of-JavaScript challenge is a learning program designed to improve JavaScript skills by completing daily coding exercises. The challenge is structured in a way that each day focuses on a specific topic, such as variables, functions, arrays, objects, and more.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders, where each folder represents a day of the challenge. Here's an overview of the folder structure:
    
    ├── 01-first-topic
